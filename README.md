# Mizu
Mizu is a free and open-source (FOSS) spaced-repetition flashcard application based on FSRS. Mizu is the forever-free and completely cross-platform successor to Anki. Mizu is intended to be a feature-complete replacement of the beloved Anki application. Mizu was created in light of Anki's ownership transfer to a for-profit organization. Mizu is designed from the ground-up to be fully cross-platform: it can run on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile (iPhone, Android) with a first-class plugin system that is available everywhere.

  - Or use Mizu's cloud sync which can be shared across your devices, similar to Obsidian
